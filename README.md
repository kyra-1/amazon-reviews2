                                         Project Workflow
This project utilizes Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python, to create a user-friendly interface for analyzing customer reviews of fashion products on Amazon. Here's a breakdown of the workflow:
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:
•	The application starts by loading compressed JSON files containing customer reviews (AMAZON_FASHION.json.gz) and product metadata (meta_AMAZON_FASHION.json.gz).
•	These files are decompressed line by line, parsed into Python dictionaries, and converted into Pandas DataFrames for efficient manipulation.
•	We filter out any reviews missing textual content to ensure we analyze valid reviews only.
2. User Interface and Product Selection:
•	Flask renders an initial HTML template (index.html) providing a user interface for the application.
•	The user interacts with the interface to enter an ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) of a specific fashion product they want to analyze.
•	Upon submitting the ASIN, the application retrieves relevant reviews and product details from the prepared DataFrames.
3. Review Analysis and Sentiment Extraction:
•	Depending on the user's choice (positive or negative reviews), the application filters the reviews based on overall rating (greater than or equal to 4 for positive, less than or equal to 3 for negative).
•	Text data from the filtered reviews is then preprocessed using a TF-IDF Vectorizer. This technique transforms the text into numerical features, considering both the frequency of terms within individual reviews and their overall presence across all reviews.

•	Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a dimensionality reduction technique, is applied to the vectorized data. LDA identifies latent topics within the reviews, uncovering hidden themes and recurring patterns. The most significant words associated with these topics are extracted for further analysis.
4. OpenAI Integration and Summarization:
•	The application leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo large language model to interpret the LDA topics and generate a summary.
•	For positive reviews, the prompt provided to GPT-3 focuses on identifying key aspects and features that customers highlight. For negative reviews, the focus shifts to understanding the main issues and problems customers have with the product.
•	OpenAI generates a response summarizing the key points extracted from the LDA topics, providing a human-readable interpretation of customer sentiment.
5. Result Presentation:
•	Finally, the application displays the results on a dedicated HTML template (results.html).
•	This template showcases the identified LDA topics with the most significant words and presents the summary generated by OpenAI, offering insights into customer sentiment towards the chosen product.
Overall, this project demonstrates the combination of Flask for web development, machine learning techniques like TF-IDF and LDA for analyzing textual data, and OpenAI's powerful language model to extract meaningful insights from customer reviews. This user-friendly application empowers users to gain a deeper understanding of customer sentiment for various fashion products on Amazon.
